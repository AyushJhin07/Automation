# SSO, SCIM, and Compliance Implementation Plan

This document captures the implementation scope that was requested and enumerates the concrete engineering tasks that would be required to safely deliver the features in production. The current codebase contains a highly simulated `SSOManager` along with no database persistence for SSO providers or sessions, no SCIM endpoints, and no automated audit/compliance reporting surface in the admin UI. Delivering the requested functionality will require a large, multi-team effort that cannot be finished in a single iteration. The sections below outline the recommended phases.

## 1. Replace simulated SSO providers with production integrations

1. **Database migrations**
   - Create normalized tables for SSO providers, identity provider metadata, certificates, and active sessions.
   - Record association to organizations and link sessions to users for auditing.
2. **Library selection and integration**
   - Adopt proven packages such as `@node-saml/passport-saml` for SAML and `openid-client` for OIDC/OAuth flows.
   - Design a provider abstraction that wraps these libraries and exposes a consistent interface to the rest of the platform.
3. **Token/session persistence**
   - Store issued tokens, refresh tokens, and session metadata in the database.
   - Implement rotation and revocation policies that respect organization-level security settings.
4. **Security and compliance hardening**
   - Add certificate rotation workflows, metadata refresh, and automated validation against security baselines.
   - Ensure audit events are written to the central audit log service.

## 2. SCIM v2 provisioning endpoints and jobs

1. **Schema modeling**
   - Extend the database to track SCIM access tokens, sync checkpoints, and pending provisioning jobs.
   - Map SCIM user/group resources onto existing organization membership models.
2. **API surface**
   - Build authenticated SCIM v2 endpoints for `/Users`, `/Groups`, `/ServiceProviderConfig`, and `/Bulk` operations.
   - Implement JSON schema validation and comprehensive error handling per RFC 7644.
3. **Background orchestration**
   - Enqueue provisioning tasks that call into `OrganizationService` for creating, updating, and deactivating members.
   - Add retry policies, dead-letter handling, and observability dashboards for sync health.

## 3. Admin UI: compliance reporting and IP allowlist management

1. **Audit/compliance reports**
   - Design server endpoints that query the audit log store and generate downloadable PDF/CSV artifacts.
   - Surface reports in the admin interface with filtering by organization, date range, and compliance framework.
2. **IP allowlist management**
   - Build UI components backed by OrganizationService for creating, editing, and deleting IP ranges.
   - Implement optimistic updates, validation, and confirmation dialogs.

## 4. End-to-end test coverage

1. **SSO flow automation**
   - Stand up test identity providers (SAML + OIDC) and run browser-driven login scenarios.
2. **SCIM sync flows**
   - Seed SCIM payloads and assert that users/groups are created, updated, and deprovisioned correctly.
3. **Policy enforcement**
   - Add integration tests covering IP allowlists, MFA requirements, and compliance gating for downloads.

## Dependencies and sequencing

Because these changes cut across authentication, backend services, database migrations, background workers, and the frontend, the work should be planned across multiple sprints with dedicated QA and security reviews. Attempting to implement everything at once would create unacceptable risk. The deliverables above should therefore be treated as a roadmap rather than a single change request.
