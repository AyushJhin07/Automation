# Wave A Connector Graduations — September 30, 2025

These notes capture the QA outcomes used to promote the latest Wave A connectors to
"graduated" status in the connector expansion roadmap. The tests were executed via the
`npm run ci:smoke` pipeline, which exercises the connector fixtures bundled with the
finance client regression suite.

## NetSuite
- **Scope covered:** customer list pagination, sales order creation guards, OAuth header injection.
- **Test evidence:** [`FinanceAPIClients.test.ts`](../../../server/integrations/__tests__/FinanceAPIClients.test.ts)
  verifies that the NetSuite client hits the SuiteTalk REST domain with normalized query
  parameters and bearer auth when listing customers, and that record creation helpers
  sanitize payloads before issuing POST requests.
- **Result:** ✅ Passed in CI on 2025-09-30. No regressions observed.

## Xero
- **Scope covered:** contact creation envelope, tenant scoping via `Xero-Tenant-Id`, and
  error surface area for invoice interactions.
- **Test evidence:** [`FinanceAPIClients.test.ts`](../../../server/integrations/__tests__/FinanceAPIClients.test.ts)
  exercises the Xero client to assert payload wrapping, header injection, and response
  normalization when creating contacts via the smoke-fixture harness.
- **Result:** ✅ Passed in CI on 2025-09-30. Ready for extended staging smoke runs once
  production credentials are provisioned.

## Next steps
- Continue expanding the smoke harness to cover invoice synchronization workflows for
  both connectors.
- Feed the graduation update to the #connector-delivery and #qa-smoke Slack channels to
  keep implementation and QA teams aligned on launch readiness.
