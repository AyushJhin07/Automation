## **üìà SALES CONVERSATION FRAMEWORK**

### **üéØ DISCOVERY QUESTIONS**

**Current State Analysis:**
1. "What automation tools are you currently using?"
2. "How many integrations have failed or required custom development?"
3. "What's your monthly spend on automation tools?"
4. "How much developer time goes to integration maintenance?"
5. "What's your biggest automation pain point?"

**Value Demonstration:**
1. "Would you like to see our 149 working apps in action?"
2. "Can I show you how our AI builds automations from natural language?"
3. "Would real Google Apps Script code output interest your team?"
4. "How important is it that every advertised feature actually works?"

### **üéØ OBJECTION HANDLING**

**"We're already using Zapier"**
- **Response:** "That's great! How many of your Zaps have broken or required workarounds? Our platform guarantees 100% working implementations - every single app we advertise actually works. Plus, you get the actual Google Apps Script code, so you're never locked into a black box."

**"n8n is open source and free"**
- **Response:** "Absolutely, and we love open source! The difference is reliability and completeness. n8n relies on community contributions with varying quality. We provide enterprise-grade implementations for all 149 apps, plus AI-powered planning that actually understands your requirements, not just templates."

**"We have developers, we can build this ourselves"**
- **Response:** "Of course you can! The question is: should your developers spend months building and maintaining 149 app integrations, or focus on your core product? We've already done the heavy lifting with bulletproof implementations and enterprise deployment infrastructure."

**"What about Microsoft Power Automate?"**
- **Response:** "Power Automate is excellent if you're 100% Microsoft-centric. But most businesses use diverse SaaS tools. Our platform provides the same enterprise reliability with complete cross-platform coverage and no Microsoft licensing requirements."
